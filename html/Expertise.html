                        <h3 class="intro"></h3> 
                        <p>From my clinical Nursing work experience to working for a multinational pharmaceutical company to two fantastic supply chain corporate summer internships, I have witnessed how every organization could benefit from a great supply chain function. 
                            Practicing a sustainable and profitable supply chain system can sound complicated and even frustrating, but I also see numerous opportunities and a huge potential for growth. 
                            Technically, I was never in supply chain function before my MBA, but I had already practiced some of the major supply chain principles at work without realizing it. 
                            I learned that I could maximize my impact on people’s lives by educating myself about business and bridging the gap between the clinical and the business sides in the healthcare industry. 
                            Hence, I decided to get an MBA in supply chain and have actively sought opportunities to make my contribution since. 
                            <br>
                            Below are highlights of my journey as a soon-to-be MBA graduate.</p>

                        <h2 class="bold">Internship Experience</h2>
                        <h3 class="intro"></h3> 
                        <p>During my time at BYU, I was fortunate to work for two great companies in their supply chain function. 
                            Most recently, I spent 6 months in the advanced analytics team for material planning at Cummins, the US automotive/tech company. My job was to support the supply chain function with analytics. I led two projects that had a significant impact on the material planning side of the function. <br>
                            First, the company wanted to see how much increasing safety stock for our biggest company was going to cost us. 
                            A 100% service level means there is no possibility that we would ever have stock out, so it sounds natural to aim for 100%. 
                            However, holding inventory can be very costly, and allocating budget and space on parts that are not frequently requested would not be wise. 
                            So, my job was to analyze our current inventory level for the top 500 selling products and optimize the inventory for our customer. 
                            I found out that blindly increasing the service level to 96% or 97% would cost us almost double the cost that we are currently spending. 
                            It turned out we were already operating at 96% level (aggregated) and raising the service level by 1% would force us to double our budget. 
                            I gathered more data to see how long it would for each part to be stocked, and how frequently they have been ordered by our customer. 
                            Using the open solver function, I was able to find the optimal level for each of the 500 parts within three different budgets ($1.5 million, $2M, and $3M). 
                            This way, we would save space in the warehouse for the parts that are ordered most frequently. 
                            Not only did I show Cummins the most ideal, optimized way to manage their inventory, but also, I helped enhance customer experience and retention.  
                            My analysis was sent straight to the decision-making team who implemented my suggestion. 
                            <br>
                            For my second project, I was responsible for forecasting demand for a certain injector for the next three years. 
                            In most cases, forecasting is done with the historical demand and data. 
                            However, I had very little data to work with since this injector was new to the market. Instead of relying on historical demand data, I analyzed the warranty claim data for this product to see if I could calculate the life time of the injector. Unfortunately, the warranty claim data didn’t yield the findings that I was looking for. However, at least I knew enough about the data to rule it out, and that could narrow down my search. Eventually, I utilized the engine demand data for the next 5 years to forecast injector demand since those injectors would go into the engines. Forecasting cannot be 100% accurate, and there is no way for me to see if my numbers would be anywhere close to the actual ones, but I provided a baseline forecasting for reference which was sustainable because the engine demand data would always be available. 
                            As an individual who had no previous background in data analytics, I was stretched and challenged a lot. There was some serious growing pain, but now I truly appreciate why data drives decisions. I have learned to appreciate the beauty of analytics and enjoyed the confidence the analytics provides for us.
                            <br><br>
                            Last year, I interned at Bayer, a German pharmaceutical company, as a procurement masters intern. 
                            I was fortunate to be part of two great projects as well.<br>
                            At the time, Bayer was expanding its presence in natural and women’s health spaces, and this emerging presence would increase the demand for probiotics as well. 
                            So it was a good time to research the market and evaluate our suppliers to decide what we need to do to prepare ourselves. 
                            The ultimate goals are to understand our current situation and make strategic decisions for the future. 
                            The outcomes will be improved quality, greater savings, efficient use of resources, stronger relationships with suppliers, a better understanding of the market and an increased focus on collaboration and innovation on the technologies. <br>
                            My task was creating chapter 1 of the category strategy framework. In this chapter, I defined scope and hierarchy of probiotics category. 
                            I paved the path for a successful strategy development as well as for effective supplier management by providing a structured approach to identifying key suppliers through these charts. 
                            My findings from Chapter one also give us a clear understanding of the current situation of the category and the vision for the future. 
                            By managing the “Probiotics Category” Bayer would be able identify the key priority areas “Where To Play” and select strategic suppliers for future collaboration that will support Bayer’s “How to Win” strategy. Chapter 1 is the start, and my project sponsor took over and finish the category strategy after my internship ended. <br>
                            For my second project, I worked with the marketing team to implement a central scoping system in the US Market Access agencies. 
                            Until now, all the market access agency scopes have been communicated through individual excel files, but once all this information goes into this new tool, Bayer would have access to real-time dashboard and reporting analysis. 
                            This digitalization offers transparent cost comparison as it gives better oversight on the allocation of brand agency budget; as a result, we would have opportunities for cost reduction or re-investment across agency spend. 
                            <br>

                            To tackle this project, I turned the tactics and deliverables that were identified last year into generic tactics and deliverables for standardization. 
                            Then, I drove data input effort for digitization by sending out templates to market access agencies to customize the agency information to fit into the tool’s format. 
                            I also established both external and internal points of contact per brand as all this information will be needed for the tool. <br>
                            Because of my contribution, the scoping tool was able to be launched last Fall as scheduled and has helped the company become more cost-conscious and cost-effective.</p>

                            <p>I am a chosen member of the BYU Savage Global Supply Chain Consulting Association and have been part of sourcing/transportation/logistics project and procurement standardization project for external companies. Both projects were heavily excel based and our customers implemented my quantifiable deliverables. 
                            <br>
                            Additionally, I’m obtaining a STEM degree in order to be more advanced with analytics and technology.

                        <p>As a former healthcare professional with an MBA, I truly believe that I have a lot to offer. 
                            I’m passionate about connecting the clinical and the business sides of the healthcare industry and making the industry more efficient and stronger. 
                            A major area for me to focus is increasing sustainability. With the climate changes and so much waste, I absolutely think that sustainability is the best way for any industry to not just survive but to thrive.

                            After graduation, I will be going back to Cummins. As a new senior sourcing analyst, I will be responsible for streamlining the sourcing process and increasing productivity and efficiency. 
                            I can’t wait to learn more about the company and share what I will have learned. </p>
